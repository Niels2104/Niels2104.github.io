    <h2> Songs</h2>
    
    <p class= "song-lyrics"> I love my dog as much as I love you, <br>
        But you may fade, my dog will always come through <br>
        All he asks from me is the food to give him strength <br>
        All he ever needs is love and that he knows he'll get <br>
        So, I love my dog as much as I love you <br>
        But you may fade, my dog will always come through <br>
        All the pay I need comes a-shinin' through his eyes <br>
