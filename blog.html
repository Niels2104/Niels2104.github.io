        <p>Richmond tigers won the AFL grand final.</p>
        <p>I watched the grand final where Richmond won against Geelong. I believe Geelong should've have won the grand final since
        <p>they've have not won a grand final since 2011 
        <p>where as Richmond, they won it back to back 2020 and 2019. 
        <p>Geelong deserved it more since they have not been in the finals since 2011 when they
        <p>won it against Collingwood.
